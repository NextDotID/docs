To get started, let's walk through a binding process with the most frequently used platform: Twitter - let's go!

## Prerequisites
- [Next.ID](http://next.id/) offers support for a standard REST API format across all services.
- Familiarity with any programming language is sufficient for getting started.
- For demonstration purposes, we primarily use Python, TypeScript, and Node.js, as these are among the most commonly used programming languages.
- A basic understanding of cryptography will be beneficial.

New to this but keen on learning? Don't panic, you can learn it all in just a few hours!

## Step-by-step: Setting up your first Avatar
In the Crypto world, a cryptographic key pair is what stands as one of your Avatars. Next.ID uses by far the most secure algorithm to protect your sovereignty: curve secp256k1.

We're showing it by using Python's¬†[secp256k1-py](https://pypi.org/project/secp256k1/).

First, install secp256k1-py lib:

```bash
# get PIP installed in advance or use your own way
pip install secp256k1
```

Then generate your own private and public key pair:

```bash
python -m secp256k1 privkey -p

# ATTENTION! We intentionally replaced the last three digits of private key to be xxx.
# Your private key is EVERYTHING. NEVER expose it to others or reveal it anywhere publicly.
43c25fecc20e6b2a0d86c81a0202d125c0181deb9975d1170d80378c7e05bxxx
Public key: 03bce884894fdc4fb45475733be317dd3c289f003bceebb097ac79a6b95e6edc56
```

With this one key pair, you now create an Avatar secured by unbreakable cryptography.

## Binding your Twitter account
From here, we're demonstrating the whole process by using a Twitter handle and key-pair as generated above. Replace all fields with your own information -- you'll be prompted to do so accordingly.

Please take note especially to replace `your_twitter_handle`.

### Get a payload

If we're heading into space, there'll be a Rocket carrying us as a payload. Entering Cyberspace each time is similar.

First, let's get the payload needed to represent us. Calling REST API `/proof/payload` by using POSTMAN or using cURL in the command line:

![](../../static/img/get-payload.png)

Replace the `identity` and `public_key` fields with your own information, and it will return like:

```json
{
    "post_content": {
        "default": "üé≠ Verifying my Twitter ID @your_twitter_handle for @NextDotID.\nSig: %SIG_BASE64%\n\nInstall Mask.io to enhance your Web3 experience.\n",
        "en_US": "üé≠ Verifying my Twitter ID @your_twitter_handle for @NextDotID.\nSig: %SIG_BASE64%\n\nInstall Mask.io to enhance your Web3 experience.\n",
        "zh_CN": "üé≠ Ê≠£Âú®ÈÄöËøá @NextDotID È™åËØÅÊàëÁöÑ Twitter Â∏êÂè∑ @your_twitter_handle „ÄÇ\nSig: %SIG_BASE64%\n\nËØ∑‰∏ãËΩΩÂÆâË£Ö Mask.io ÂéªÂ¢ûÂº∫ÊÇ®ÁöÑ Web3 ‰ΩìÈ™å„ÄÇ\n"
    },
    "sign_payload": "{\"action\":\"create\",\"created_at\":\"1656843378\",\"identity\":\"your_twitter_handle\",\"platform\":\"twitter\",\"prev\":\"KNyNFtvhlRVJh/oU6RryK2n+C2dja9aLQPjlv5VHMsQErZROojEmMAgmeEQVC094EOuHIYcv3lCYXf8d3zqDCQE=\",\"uuid\":\"77f5ccaa-7919-4854-96de-81975f96744a\"}",
    "uuid": "77f5ccaa-7919-4854-96de-81975f96744a",
    "created_at": "1656843378"
}
```

`sign_payload` is the payload we're looking for. `uuid` and `created_at` are also required for the following steps.

### Generate the signature

With the payload returned, we can go ahead to sign it. Git clones our [open-source Demo in TypeScript](https://github.com/nextdotid/Signature-Generating-Sample) to accomplish this.

Note: you'll need to set up Node.js and TypeScript before downloading, then go to install the required libs as `ethereumjs-util`.

Open the `index.ts` file under `/src` and replace the `const message` with the string `sign_payload` in the former step:

```typescript
import { ecsign, toRpcSig, keccakFromString, BN } from 'ethereumjs-util';

async function personalSign(message: Buffer, privateKey: Buffer): Promise<Buffer> {
    const messageHash = keccakFromString(`\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n${message.length}${message}`, 256)
    const signature = ecsign(messageHash, privateKey)
    return Buffer.from(toRpcSig(signature.v, signature.r, signature.s).slice(2), 'hex')
}

async function main() {
    // this message come from the return attribute "sign_payload" of everytime calling API: v1/proof/payload
    const message = Buffer.from('{\"action\":\"create\",\"created_at\":\"1656843378\",\"identity\":\"your_twitter_handle\",\"platform\":\"twitter\",\"prev\":\"KNyNFtvhlRVJh/oU6RryK2n+C2dja9aLQPjlv5VHMsQErZROojEmMAgmeEQVC094EOuHIYcv3lCYXf8d3zqDCQE=\",\"uuid\":\"353449e6-3a6f-4ac8-ae65-ba14bf466baf\"}', 'utf8');
    // ATTENTION! RUN THIS LOCALLY! NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY WITH ANY OTHERS OR PUBLIC!
    // replace XXX with your own Private Key for generating a signature
    const secretKey = Buffer.from('XXX', 'hex');
    const signature = await personalSign(message, secretKey);

    console.log(`Signature: 0x${signature.toString('hex')}`);
    // For demo ONLY
    // Signature: 0xf72fe6b00be411bd70ffe1b9bf322f18529ea10e9559dd26ba10387544849fc86d712709dfb709efc3dcc0a01b6f6b9ca98bd48fe780d58921f4926c6f2c0b871b

    console.log(`Signature(base64): ${signature.toString('base64')}`);
    // For demo ONLY
    // Signature(base64): 9y/msAvkEb1w/+G5vzIvGFKeoQ6VWd0muhA4dUSEn8htcScJ37cJ78PcwKAbb2ucqYvUj+eA1Ykh9JJsbywLhxs=
}

main();
```

Now we can run it properly. Go to the root directory to compile:

```bash
$ tsc
```

Go to the `/disc` directory to get it running:

```bash
$ node index.js
```

We will get two console.log outputs. One is the Signature(base64) that we're going to use for proof posting on Twitter.

### Post a proof Tweet

Follow the format we get in calling `/proof/payload`, replace the `Sig` with Signature(base64) we just get and visit twitter.com to tweet as below:

```
üé≠ Verifying my Twitter ID @your_twitter_handle for @NextDotID.
Sig: 9y/msAvkEb1w/+G5vzIvGFKeoQ6VWd0muhA4dUSEn8htcScJ37cJ78PcwKAbb2ucqYvUj+eA1Ykh9JJsbywLhxs=

Next.ID YOUR DIGITAL IDENTITIES IN ONE PLACE
```

Then go to the detail page of this tweet, get its ID at the end of the URL like `1543541274254639104``:

```
https://twitter.com/your_twitter_handle/status/1543541274254639104
```

This ID will be the `proof_location` we need for verification.

### Verify the proof

We're getting close! Call the REST API `/proof` by using POSTMAN or using cURL in the command line:

![](../../static/img/verify-post.png)

It will return a code of `201` Created` and empty curly brackets :

```
{}
```

### Check your Avatar's status

All set! Let's go to have a look at our newly created Avatar.

Call REST API `/proof`with `GET` method and with two fields of `platform` and `identity`:

```
https://proof-service.nextnext.id/v1/proof?platform=twitter&identity=your_twitter_handle
```

We will get as below:

```json
{
    "pagination": {
        "total": 4,
        "per": 20,
        "current": 1,
        "next": 0
    },
    "ids": [
        {
            "avatar": "0x03bce884894fdc4fb45475733be317dd3c289f003bceebb097ac79a6b95e6edc56",
            "proofs": [
                {
                    "platform": "twitter",
                    "identity": "your_twitter_handle",
                    "created_at": "1656844114",
                    "last_checked_at": "1656844114",
                    "is_valid": true,
                    "invalid_reason": ""
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Congrats! You have successfully created an Avatar on-chain and bound it to your Twitter account.
